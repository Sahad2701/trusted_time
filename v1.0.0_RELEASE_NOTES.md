# TrustedTime v1.0.0 - Release

We are proud to announce the first major stable release of **TrustedTime**, the premier high-integrity time engine for Flutter. 

This release marks the transition of the project from a utility to a production-grade library designed for enterprise security, anti-fraud, and licensing systems.

## Key Highlights

### Tamper-Proof Time Engine
Replaces the unreliable system wall-clock with a secure virtual clock anchored to hardware monotonic oscillators. Immune to user adjustments, platform clock jumps, and timezone manipulation.

### Multi-Source Consensus (Marzullo's)
Implements true distributed time resolution. By querying multiple Tier-1 NTP and HTTPS sources in parallel, the engine derives a consensus time while automatically rejecting outliers and malicious network skew.

### Zero-Overhead Performance
Optimized for the most demanding applications. `TrustedTime.now()` is a synchronous, memory-cached operation with sub-microsecond latency and zero GC impact.

### Intelligent Offline Continuity
Once anchored via a network quorum, TrustedTime remains accurate indefinitely without an active internet connection—perfect for offline-first apps that still need security.

### Thundering Herd Protection
Equipped with a "Full Jitter" exponential backoff strategy, ensuring that millions of app instances won't overwhelm your time infrastructure during network recovery events.
